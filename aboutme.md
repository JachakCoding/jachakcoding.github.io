My name is Akshay Jachak. I have the following qualities:

- I'm a great writer.
- I'm curious about learning new tech.

### My story
I have been working as a technical writer for more than 7 years. I started out as a documentation engineer at Cyient (formerly known as Citec). After working there for 4.5 years, I started a new adventure in IT industry with QuickHeal (One of India's well-known brands). At QuickHeal, I handled different type of documentation such as User Guides, Administrator Guides, Release Notes, etc. Currently, I'm working as a Technical Author at Operative Media. In my role, I regularly interact with stakeholders like Developers, Product Mangaers, and other Subject Matter Experts to collect information. These days, I'm also learning and actively doing hands-on activites in [The Cloud Seminar](https://thecloudseminar.com/) course . I have been building this website as a part of one assignment in this course. It has been a beautiful journey so far.
